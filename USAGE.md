* `login` - (Required) The login of the user
* `password` - (Required) The password of the user
* `groups` - (Required) A list of groups the user belongs to
* `description` - The description of the user
* `last_name` - The last name of the user
* `first_name` - The first name of the user
* `email` - The email address of the user

Creating a User:
```
resource "solidserver_user" "myFirstUser" {
   login = "jsmith"
   password = "a_very_c0mpl3x_P@ssw0rd"
   description = "My Very First User Resource"
   last_name = "Smith"
   first_name = "John"
   email = "j.smith@efficientip.com"
   groups = [ "${solidserver_usergroup.grp_admin.id}" ]
}
```

## Group
Groups associate users with authorization rules and SOLIDserver resources. They are created based on the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the group
* `description` - description of the group

Creating a Group:
```
resource "solidserver_usergroup" "t_group_01" {
  name = "group01"
  description = "descr01"
}
```

Getting information from a group based on its name:
```
data "solidserver_usergroup" "t_group_01" {
  name = "group01"
}
```
